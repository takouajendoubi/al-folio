[**STAT0004: Introduction to Practical Statistics**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/introduction-to-practical-statistics-STAT0004)

This module aims to provide training in the basic skills of practical statistics using a statistical software package. Modern statistical analysis in practice is almost entirely computer-based, and statistical software packages are widely used in all areas of quantitative investigation. The R package is widely used and extremely powerful, thereby providing students with a solid basis for using other packages in a wide variety of application areas. Together with STAT0002 and STAT0003, it provides the foundation for further study of statistics in the degree programmes offered by the Department of Statistical Science or jointly with other departments. On successful completion of the module, a student should be able to use the R statistical software package for data analysis and simulation; be able to identify and carry out an appropriate statistical analysis of a simple data set using a computer; and be able to interpret the output from a statistical software package when used for simple statistical analyses.


[**STAT0034: Skills Development Workshops**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/research-project-STAT0034)

This module aims to enable students to apply Statistical Science to real world problems and to present their findings in a written report. It is intended for students registered on certain taught postgraduate degree programmes offered by the Department of Statistical Science. Preparation for the project starts with several practical exercises, presented and discussed in workshop sessions during Terms 1 and 2. Topics include preparing and presenting short talks, presenting information in tabular and graphical form, reading and digesting other people's research, and the use of the document preparing system LaTeX. Students typically begin work on their project at the start of June. Over the course of the project, student and supervisor meet regularly.

**Mathematical and Statistical Modeling**

The aim of the course is to give a solid grounding in the concepts of probability and statistical modelling. Emphasis is placed on asking the right questions, and testing and questioning assumptions, and on using robust statistical tools that can cope with departures from the assumptions. Graphical analyses are used whenever possible, and "exploratory" data analysis is encouraged. Exercises are introduced regularly throughout the lectures to immediately reinforce the material being discussed; these are usually of a practical nature.

**Graphical Models**

Graphical models are those probability models whose independence structure is characterised by a graph, the conditional independence graph. In this course we will look at some aspects of graphical modelling for both (a) a vector of random variables, and (b) vector-valued time series. We will look at models and their estimation. Topics covered include: dependence structure and graphical representation; Markov properties for undirected graphs; the conditional independence graph; decomposable models; graphical Gaussian models; model selection; acyclic directed graphical models; global directed Markov property;Bayesian networks; graphical modelling of time series; model selection for time series graphs.
