I am currently a Lecturer in Statistical Science (Teaching) in [the department of Statistical Science at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/). I also hold a Honorary Research Fellowship at Imperial College London. 

I am a Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/) and have received the [Postgraduate Certificate in University Teaching and Learning](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff/educational-development/programmes/pg-cert-ult/) at Imperial.
 
I am both a data science and statistical science educator interested in pedagogical research and a statistician with interest in Bayesian statistics.

**I am a data science educator with interest in pedagogical research.** My ultimate aim is to share effective ways of teaching statistics to non-specialists or people with little to no prior experience in data science and develop reproducible educational tools and methods to make statistics teaching and learning accessible to the wider audience. I am committed to increase student engagement with statistical or programming modules, fostering collaborative learning and student-staff partnership in educational research.

**I am a statistician with interest in Bayesian statistics and missing data imputation.** My work focuses on developing statistical methods for *unstructured and heterogeneous data integration* with applications i) to educational data mining to serve pedagogical questions of interest such as student engagement and educational outcomes and ii) to heterogeneous biomedical data e.g. post-genomic data, multi-omics, clinical data and physiological data to understand complex biological processes.

I teach a number of statistical [modules](/teaching/) at undergraduate and graduate levels to both specialists and non-specialists but also take part in outreach activities to introduce A-level students to data science.
 
 I did my PhD in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Imperial College under the supervision of [Korbinian Strimmer](https://strimmerlab.github.io/) (Epidemiology and Biostatistics), [Timothy Ebbels](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.ebbels), [Robert Glen](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.glen) and [Elaine Holmes](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/elaine.holmes) (Computational and Systems Medicine).
 Afterwards I joined the department of Mathematics as a Strategic Teaching Fellow. Before coming to the UK, I was a research engineer at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in France.
